# Minimum Viable Organisation (MVO)
## What roles do we need to form a tech organisation?

Here I propose a MVO, designed to show what a tech business actually needs to look like to function day to day, and not fall over when something goes slightly wrong, or badly wrong. This was just an exercise I did one day and have used it in my day job. It's a proposal, and hopefully useful to people. It's based on what I've seen over the last 25 years working with many organisations of all sizes. I wouldn't call myself an expert in these matters but I present this here as a base for others to build on, or modify and I do hope it is usefull.
