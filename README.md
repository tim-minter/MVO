# Minimum Viable Organisation (MVO)
## What roles do we need to form a tech organisation?

Here I propose a MVO, designed to show what a tech business actualy needs to look like to function day to day, and not fall over when something goes slightly wrong, or badly wrong. I wouldn't call myself an expert in this, but I know what I've seen over the last 25 years working with 100's of organisations of all sizes and a good chunk of time in enterprise size orgs.

I also include a draw.io opensource file here [here](https://github.com/tim-minter/MVO/blob/main/minimum%20viable%20organisation%20(generic).drawio) for your reuse. Please note the licence for this repo.
